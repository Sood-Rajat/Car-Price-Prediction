# Car Price Prediction
The problem we're addressing during the process of buying and selling the car is finding a price that satisfies both the buyer and the seller. And to help the market analysts which can understand the cars pricing trends better.
To overcome this problem, I have used a dataset listing cars from various manufacturers, along with their prices, based on key features such as mileage, engine volume, and wheels. Within this dataset, I conducted data analysis, including data cleaning and visualization using graphs and charts. Then, I built machine learning models in the end. These machine learning models are capable of accurately predicting car prices, which can assist both buyers and sellers throughout the buying and selling process.
# How Models are selected for the project:
I have first pre-process the data in this I had done all the cleaning, reshaping of the feature and then trained the data:
1.	Training and Evaluation: Train the selected models using historical data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
2.	Accuracy: Build a model that provides accurate price predictions to assist buyers, sellers, and dealers in making informed decisions.
3.	Automation: Create an automated system that takes input data about a car (such as its make, model, year, mileage etc.) and produces a predicted price without manual intervention.
4.	Feature Importance: Determine which features have the most significant impact on car prices. This can help us to understand market dynamics and what factors influence pricing the most.
# Testing are Training and all the key metrics used in the project:
I have used the functions like:
1. Train-Test Split:
•	Training Set: A portion (typically 70-80%) of the dataset is used to train the machine learning model.
•	Testing Set: The remaining data (20-30%) is reserved for testing the model's performance. This is used to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
2. Metrics:
•	Common evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).
•	Classification tasks may use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, etc.
3. Confusion Matrix:
Used in classification problems. It shows the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, enabling a more detailed analysis of model performance.
4. ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve:
These curves help visualize the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate or precision and recall for different thresholds.
